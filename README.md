# BankAccountTypes
BankAccountTypes is a C++ console app that allows the user to add any number of Checking, Savings, or Basic account types, and then add an initial balance to each. The Checking and Savings account options are extensions of the basic Bank Account class. Checking overrides the debit and credit methods of the base class, adding a transaction fee when those methods are called. Savings adds an annualized monthly interest feature to the account. Once all accounts have been added, the program iterates through each account, allowing the user to add or withdraw more funds.
